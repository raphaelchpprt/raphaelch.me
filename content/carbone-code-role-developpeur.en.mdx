When I started working in greentech, I saw code as purely technical and virtual. Over time, I understood that beyond being a powerful means of expression and action, it was never neutral.

Every choice has an impact: from the energy consumed to user attention. This idea led me to approach development differently: no longer as simply building features, but as a chain of decisions that shape both the product and its footprint.

## Code impacts reality

An extra button, a script loaded by default, a poorly optimized animation: all minor choices that end up weighing down the whole. Nothing dramatic at the prototype scale. But when a product scales up, these details become quantities of data transferred and electricity consumed.

Treating them with consideration may seem anecdotal when we know their relative scope compared to the scale of necessary changes. In reality, it's a strong signal: we integrate sobriety as a quality criterion.

In an ecologically-focused project, fulfilling one's duty of exemplarity is a guarantee of credibility. Applying the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">YAGNI</a> principle, preferring <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">progressive enhancement</a>, and avoiding <a href="https://medium.com/just-tech-it-now/les-sympt%C3%B4mes-de-lover-engineering-78ebd963a81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">over-engineering</a> count (almost) as much as the discourse. Assumed with consistency and publicly claimed, this rigor ends up changing norms and practices.

*Some will call them sacrifices or obstacles to innovation. I prefer to see them as opportunities. Opportunities to rethink a healthier relationship with digital: a set of safeguards against its excesses, and against the "<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2025/04/23/la-merdification-ce-processus-inexorable-de-degradation-de-la-qualite-des-services-sur-les-plateformes-numeriques_6599211_3232.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">enshittification</a>" that many products experience.*

## The hidden side behind the screen

Because everything happens in the cloud, we forget that digital technology relies on heavy physical infrastructure (data centers, submarine cables, battery production and consumption, ...). Digital accounts for about 4% of global COâ‚‚ emissions according to <a href="https://theshiftproject.org/publications/mondes-virtuels-reseaux-double-contrainte-carbone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Shift Project</a>, and its share keeps increasing.

At this scale, efficiency is not a luxury but a guideline that should direct us. It's also a lever. A site that loads faster on an old phone is both a better user experience and a significant energy saving considering the number of requests made.

We often hear about the "rebound effect," but using it as a pretext for inaction means ignoring two essential points:
1. Without a minimum of optimization from the start, future usage will only amplify waste.
2. Lowering the energy cost of each action and setting simple limits allows us to stay sober even as the service grows.

Efficiency thus becomes a strategic choice.

## Sobriety and UX, hand in hand

Lightening doesn't mean removing value, it means removing what slows down or distracts. Less data sent, fewer unnecessary screens, images at the right size, texts that get to the point: the page arrives faster, the user understands sooner, the device consumes less.

Since simplicity is often not simple to achieve, the constraint (making it accessible, light, and clear) becomes a driver of creativity: we reduce, we simplify, we rephrase, and the interface breathes.

*Achieving the useful effect for the minimum energy and attention spent. Saying no early (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">YAGNI</a> principle) to free up time and take care of what we keep. We remove before adding, we clarify before optimizing.*

This is especially true for a carbon footprint SaaS where the user is generally not an expert. They need a product that communicates clearly and makes a large volume of scientific data intelligible. They must always be able to extract the best possible insights from it.

## Developing is making trade-offs

The developer's job is not just about translating mockups into code, even more so in the age of artificial intelligence. It requires setting technical limits (<a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/performance-budgets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">performance budgets</a>) and simplifying design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">KISS</a> principle). And sometimes also saying "no." Accepting not to build or considering alternatives already improves the product.

It also means sharing responsibility: on the server what needs to be robust, in the browser what can be calculated at display time, and documenting these choices (e.g. <a href="https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ADR</a>) so the team maintains collective coherence.

## Beyond "code-focused"

A good developer is not reduced to the quantity of lines produced. Their value lies in their ability to think ahead, know how to delegate, and implement safeguards that will guarantee both the product's sustainability and that of the world in which it evolves.

These choices seem minimal taken in isolation. But together, they sketch another way of building: more sober, more robust, more clear, more respectful. In a greentech environment, this coherence seems essential to me for those who want to gain efficiency.

## Wrapping up

Development is not a neutral activity. Coding means orienting, choosing, showing responsibility. It's deciding what digital world we put into circulation.

Sobriety doesn't limit creativity, but it sets a course and establishes a framework. It makes products more accessible, faster, more sustainable. And along the way, it gives meaning back to the developer's profession.
